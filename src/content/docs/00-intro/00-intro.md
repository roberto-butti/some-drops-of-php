# Welcome to Some drops of PHP

## The reason why
This book collects some useful, unknown, underrated PHP functions or stuff discovered, used, and learned during PHP's daily use.

Using frameworks daily, sometimes the perception of the power of the language and the basic functionalities provided by the PHP core could be lost. I see that usually, I used to look at the framework documentation or look for a package in Packagist for the system, array, and string functions instead of using core functionalities provided by the language.

While I wrote this book, I also wrote some scripts to better understand the behavior of the functions. You can find these examples here: https://github.com/roberto-butti/some-drops-of-php in the _examples_ directory.

### Continuous release

I was thinking of printing this book, but I think that is not so eco-friendly and a book about development could be improved daily in terms of spellchecking and the content and examples. So, I expect to adopt the same approach in the software with the CI/CD, with a continuous release of the book.

### Releases
