This book collects some useful, unknown, underrated PHP functions or stuff discovered, used, and learned during PHP's daily use.

## The reason why

Using frameworks daily, sometimes the perception of the power of the language and the basic functionalities provided by the PHP core could be lost. I see that usually, I used to look at the framework documentation or look for a package in Packagist for the system, array, and string functions instead of using core functionalities provided by the language.

While I wrote this book, I also wrote some scripts to better understand the behavior of the functions. You can find these examples here: https://github.com/roberto-butti/some-drops-of-php in the _examples_ directory.

### Continuous release

I was thinking of printing this book, but I think that is not so eco-friendly and a book about development could be improved daily in terms of spellchecking and the content and examples. So, I expect to adopt the same approach in the software with the CI/CD, with a continuous release of the book.
