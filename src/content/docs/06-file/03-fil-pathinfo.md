## Split filename infos: `pathinfo()`

The function `pathinfo()` is useful when you have a filename and you want to obtain:

- `dirname`: the directory
- `basename`: the filename with extension
- `extension`: the extension
- `filename`: the filename without extension

```php
$path_parts = pathinfo(__FILE__);
print_r($path_parts);
/*
Array
(
    [dirname] => /Users/user/project/BOOKS/50-drops-of-php/examples
    [basename] => 503_fil_pathinfo.php
    [extension] => php
    [filename] => 503_fil_pathinfo
)
*/
```

The input is a string with the filename, the result is an associative array with `dirname`, `basename`, `extension`, `filename` attributes.
